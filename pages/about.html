                  The symbol for the NSS has been based on the giant Rath Wheel of the world-famous Konark Sun Temple (The Black Pagoda) situated in Odisha, India .
          The wheel portrays the cycle of creation, preservation and release .
            It signifies the movement in life across time and space, the symbol thus stands for continuity as well as change and implies the continuous striving of NSS for social change. 
                NSS song uthe samaj ke liye is made to make young India realise their potential in making the country a better place to live .
                  NSS day is celebrated on 24th September every year.
